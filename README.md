# 🐍All-Mundos-Python (Curso em Vídeo)

This repository contains all the exercises I completed while studying Python through the **Curso em Vídeo** platform, taught by Gustavo Guanabara. The course is entirely in Portuguese and offers a hands-on introduction to Python programming, structured into progressive learning modules called **"Mundos" (Worlds)**.

## 📚 Course Structure

The course is divided into three main parts (Worlds), each one building upon the previous concepts:

### 🌍 World 1: Basics of Python
- Introduction to Python
- Variables and data types
- Input and output
- Basic operators
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Simple logic and problem-solving

### 🌍 World 2: Expanding Knowledge
- More complex `for` and `while` loops
- Nested conditionals
- Lists and string manipulation
- Basic functions
- Practical problem-solving with logic challenges

### 🌍 World 3: Intermediate Python
- Functions (parameters, return values, scope)
- Tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Modules and libraries
- File handling (read/write)
- More advanced exercises and real-life challenges
